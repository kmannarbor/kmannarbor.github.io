Slug: All about Alex
Author: Alex Mendiola
Summary: A quick blurb about Alex Mendiola.

Alex Mendiola started coding back in high school. He and his friends created a text-based adventure game using BASIC. To say the least, it was sprawling, random, and unfinished, but it introduced Alex to what would become a life-long pursuit. It wasn't until recently that he decided to delve deeply into coding, not just as a hobby, but as a vocation and career.

In the past, Alex had learned basic HTML and CSS (enough to be dangerous). He would always hit a wall with regards to his understanding of the processes inherent in those technologies and then move on to other creative pursuits which included martial arts, cooking, woodworking, physical computing, and screenwriting. With the surge in online tutorials and guides, what was once inscrutable to him suddenly became accessible. 

After careers in the financial services industry as a financial advisor and public education as a high school English teacher, he decided to pursue in earnest a deeper understanding of computer programming. He selected Python as his first true programming language and this blog serves as a record of his journey from total novice to competent coder (and perhaps beyond).
