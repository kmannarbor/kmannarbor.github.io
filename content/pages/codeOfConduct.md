Summary: An explanation of acceptable conduct on this site.

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

The long and the short of our code of conduct is this: Use common sense, Be respectful, and Take responsibilty for yourself. All too often the simple application of common sense avoids conflict entirely. Make sure that you do so before commenting. Simply ask a few questions before you click submit. For instance, will my comments be interpreted by others in the manner I intend? If not, revise them. Could these comments be viewed as aggressive or overly critical? If so, reword them or don't post them at all. Is what I'm about to post considered by most to be overtly or covertly racist/sexist/nationalist/homophobic/etc.? If so, DO NOT POST IT! In fact, if your comments are racist/sexist/nationalistic/homophobic/etc. this is not the community for you. 

Being respectful falls within the confines of the above common sense guidelines above, but deserves further explanation. Comments that are merely not offensive are not necessarily respectful. Respect requires empathy. You must consider the feelings and beliefs of others in order to insure respectful discourse. That is not to say that you must agree with everyone in a given respectful conversation or debate. Again, ask yourself: Are my comments furthering the conversation or are they targeting the commenter with whom I am debating? If it's the former, you're good to go on. If the latter, slow down and determine what exactly what point you are trying to make and consider the possibility that you have lost the debate.

Taking responsibilty extends beyond the normal anonymity of internet interactions. Stand by what you've said. Admit when you have crossed a line. Apologize to those affected. Everything you do an say here or anywhere on the web lives on in perpetuity. Your comments and reputation here translates across your lifetime and beyond the limits of your keyboard and screen. Preserve it by following the above guidelines here and elsewhere. 

I'll borrow from Destructoid's Terms of Service to further define acceptable and unacceptable language and activity on this site:

<blockquote><strong>No hate speech or flaming.</strong> This includes racist, sexist, gendered, ableist, ageist, homophobic and transphobic slurs and language of any sort. Death threats and telling people to die is also a no-no.<br><br>

Think you can dump on someone of a particular faith? Bzzzzt, wrong. Want to dispense medical advice without a license? Not happening here.<br><br>

We also think rape jokes and the people who tell them suck. Don't go there. In fact, it's best to avoid punching down altogether.<br><br>

<strong>Harassment, dogpiling and gaslighting will not be tolerated toward our community members or staff.</strong> Additionally,  Destructoid will not be a forum for doxxing or obsessive, gossipy types that sift through the private lives of others be it staff, community members or even people off-site in the name of Internet "justice."<br><br>

Basically, if you think the internet is your personal playground in which you can push the least of us out because you can't share a hobby, we will show you the door. Using the Internet to vent is one thing, but if you're here to be perpetually miserable to others or neg on every game discussed, you won't be here long.<br><br>

Remember: That handle and avatar on the internet is a real human being like you with a life, problems, favorite game genres, foods and opinions that are more varied than a pack of Skittles. If you're not willing to taste the rainbow and get along with it, the mighty banhammer of Thor will fall upon ye for She is righteous and just.</blockquote>
