Summary: A quick introduction to my site.

<h1>Welcome!</h1>
On this blog you will follow my journey from novice Python Developer to competent Developer (and perhaps beyond). I'll chronicle the challenges I come across in my learning and also showcase my projects as I build them. I plan to share my thinking as I move through various tutorials and project builds. My hope is that will help you better understand software development if you are a novice like me. As I progress, I also hope it shows you my dedication and increasing skill.
